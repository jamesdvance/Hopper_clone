# Hopper Flights Clone
[Hopper](https://hopper.com/) lets a traveler save money by booking cars, hotels, and flights ahead of time. wHopper uses machine learning to predict if a flight will be lower in the future and when, they they offer to sell you the flight at a price that's between the current price and the lowest price they think it will reach. If they predict perfectly, the consumer gets an immediate discount on the flight, and they purchase the flight right at the lowest price and pocket the difference between their sale and buy price. Win/Win.
